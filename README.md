# Python-Help
Following Links in Pytohn

Start at: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Nyomi.html
Find the link at position 18 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 7 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
Hint: The first character of the name of the last page that you will load is: R

----
NOTE: This python programn works fine !! 

I would like some help understanding the script however. 

1- In line 18 what does the 'i' stand for ? / What does it do ? Can I re-name it something else ?
2- In line 21 what is 'a' ? Are we refering to the first 'a' in the html code that being '><a' or the second one '</a></li>' ?
3- In line 22 and 23 what is the purpose of [position-1] ? What does the -1 do ?
